# â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography:

### One-way functions
- One-way functions are simple to compute, but difficult to reverse
- Not useful on encryption, cause you cant decrypt it.
- Trapdoor one-way function
### One-way hash functions
- Hash-function = takes a variable-length input string (called a pre-image) and converts it to a fixed-length (generally smaller) output string (called a hash value).
- Hash-function are many-to-one
- Good one-way hash-functions are collision free. Meaning that two pre-images cannot be determined with the same hash value.
  
## a) Install Hashcat

I installed hashcat using teros introductions and using command

After successfully installing hashcat i created a new dictionary and downloaded Rockyou big dictionary.

After this i had to identify the hash type with command

then we had to tried to crack the hash with md5

Successfully cracked the sample hash

## b) Crack this hash: d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df

I did exactly the same as in the previous exercise.
