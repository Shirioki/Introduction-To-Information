# â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography:

- Cryptography = to solve problems involving secrecy, authentication, integrity, and dishonest people
- Protocols = series of steps, involving two or more parties, designed to accomplish a task.
  
## a) Install Hashcat

I installed hashcat using teros introductions and using command

After successfully installing hashcat i created a new dictionary and downloaded Rockyou big dictionary.

After this i had to identify the hash type with command

then we had to tried to crack the hash with md5

Successfully cracked the sample hash

## b) Crack this hash: d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df

I did exactly the same as in the previous exercise.
