## 1. Introduction

- Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) target sensitive information for economic or military purposes
- Traditional defenses like anti-virus aren't effective against APTs due to their sophistication
- APT involve long-term, evasive attacks requiring advanced detection and response
- The kill chain model analyzes each phase of an intrusion to block it at multiple stages
- Intelligence-driven defense helps anticipate threats and improves resilience against future attacks
- The paper introduces this approach and applies it to a real-world case study to demonstrate effectiveness

- The U.S. Department of Defense defines a kill chain with the stages: find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess. This model is used to identify gaps in surveillance capabilities and improve system development
- Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attack
- The U.S. Army describes a seven-step terrorist operational planning cycle, which is used to assess terrorist groups intent and capabilities. This model helps with antiterrorism efforts on military installations

## 3. Intelligence-driven Computer Network Defense

### 3.1 Indicators and the Indicator Life Cycle
- Intelligence-driven Computer Network Defense (CND)
- a strategy that helps protect networks from cyber threats. Uses intelligence to better understand and defend against attackers
- CND is a continuous process that uses indicators (signals or pieces of information) to detect and respond to new attacks
- goal is to make defenses more resilient by using a kill chain model
- If defenders can disrupt attack earlier, it increases the adversary costs and makes it harder for attacker to succeed
- defenders can have the upper hand by acting faster than attackers adaptation
- Indicators are pieces of information that help identify attacks. They come in 3 types:
    - Atomic: Simple, indivisible facts like IP addresses or email addresses
    - Computed: Derived data like hash values or patterns from the attack
    - Behavioral: complex patterns combining atomic and computed indicators that describe how an attack is unfolding
- The Indicator Life Cycle used to track and understand attacks. Helps improve defenses
